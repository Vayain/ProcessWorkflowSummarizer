Utilize AI to transform screenshots into detailed activity descriptions
Generate structured documentation that accurately reflects user activities
Provide customizable agent-based processing for refined results
Enable flexible documentation output in multiple formats

2. User Requirements
2.1 Target Users
Individuals who need to document their activities for:

Training material creation
Process documentation
Workflow analysis
Knowledge transfer

2.2 User Stories

As a user, I want to start/stop/restart the screenshot capture process at will.
As a user, I want to adjust the frequency of screenshot captures.
As a user, I want to see screenshots in real-time as they're being captured.
As a user, I want to view and potentially edit LLM-generated descriptions before final documentation.
As a user, I want to customize the AI agents that process my screenshots.
As a user, I want to export documentation in multiple formats (PDF, HTML, Markdown).
As a user, I want different levels of detail in the generated documentation.

3. Technical Requirements
3.1 Screenshot Capture

Default Frequency: Every 2 seconds
Adjustable Range: Allow users to set capture intervals (minimum: 1 second, maximum: 60 seconds)
Capture Control: Start, stop, and restart functionality
Capture Area: Full browser tab, window, or monitor (user-selectable)
Format: PNG or JPEG (optimized for AI model consumption)

3.2 LLM Integration

Primary Model: GPT-4o with vision capabilities
API Integration: Direct API calls to OpenAI
Prompt Engineering: Optimized prompts for activity recognition and description
Processing Queue: Efficient handling of screenshot analysis requests

3.3 Database

Storage of:

Raw screenshots (with timestamps)
LLM-generated descriptions
Final documentation
Agent configurations


Use database technology supported by Replit (likely SQLite or MongoDB)

3.4 CrewAI Agent System

Agent Roles:

Analyzer: Processes LLM-generated descriptions for accuracy and completeness
Writer: Creates cohesive documentation from individual descriptions
Reviewer: Checks for consistency, clarity, and usefulness
Orchestrator: Manages workflow between agents


Customization: User-adjustable system prompts for each agent
Orchestration: Configurable workflow between agents

3.5 Documentation Generation

Structure: Chronological organization of activities
Elements: Screenshots, descriptions, timestamps
Output Formats: PDF, HTML, Markdown
Detail Levels: Configurable granularity (summary, standard, detailed)
